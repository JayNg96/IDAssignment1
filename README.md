# My Portfolio
I have built a responsive website that will display images, video, descriptions.
This website is compatible with mobile device of any size.
 
# The purpose of this Portfolio Site.
This website is an extension of my resume. It provides a convenient way for potential clients to view my work while also allowing me to expand on my skills and services. The purpose provide a way for me to land more clients, whether that means freelance work, more clients for my agency or employment at a company.

# Design Process

Minimalism is my way to go when it comes to the design of my portfolio site. I am trying to attract new customers with my work, therefore i chose a design that draws attention toward my portfolio and any information i list about my business, not away from them. I used whitespace and sticked to only two fonts. The color scheme contrast well and the typography have a dramatic flare that draws eyes into it. I've only used animations that serve a purpose. I've made sure to use high quality images for present my work, which is especially utmost importance for photoraphers.
